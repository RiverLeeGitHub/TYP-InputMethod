# TYP-InputMethod

Sometimes it's hard to remember the spelling of a word, which often affects the efficiency of typing.
So I want to write an input method to solve this problem.
Here is my first draft of the backend.

Enter any letters of a word in sequence, then the target word is recommended.
e.g. You can enter 'mssp', 'msipi', 'miiii' or any letters you like to return 'mississippi'.ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª
